## Building

In order to build seng-boilerplate, ensure that you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

Clone a copy of the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mediamonks/seng-boilerplate.git
```

Change to the seng-boilerplate directory:
```sh
cd seng-boilerplate
```

Install dev dependencies:
```sh
yarn
```

Use one of the following main scripts:
```sh
yarn build            # build this project
yarn dev              # run compilers in watch mode, both for babel and typescript
yarn test             # run the unit tests incl coverage
yarn test:dev         # run the unit tests in watch mode
yarn lint             # run eslint and tslint on this project
yarn doc              # generate typedoc documentation
```

When installing this module, it adds a pre-commit hook, that runs lint and prettier commands
before committing, so you can be sure that everything checks out.

### Travis

This project uses [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) to build, test and
publish its code to npm. Travis is free for public Github repositories.

It runs on all commits, shows the build status for pull requests, and
publishes to npm when a new tag/release is created.

Travis only runs the `npm test` script, so have configured that script
to run everything we want Travis to check. Besides the unit tests, we
also run our validations and linters.

The travis configuration is placed in a `.travis.yml` file, consisting
of multiple sections.

1.  Defines the `node_js` [language](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs),
    and tells travis on which node versions to run the process.
2.  It can do a [npm deploy](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/npm),
    telling it to keep the generated artifacts and only publish when run
    on node stable and when a tag was committed. It also contains the email
    address and api key of the npm user.

Because we want to keep the npm api key secret, we reference an environment variable that can be
entered in the travis settings.

1.  Make sure you are logged in to your npm account with the
    [adduser](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/adduser) command:

    ```sh
    $ npm adduser
    ```

    To verify that you are logged in correctly you can check:

    ```sh
    $ npm whoami
    ```

3.  Now we need to [create a new token](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/working_with_tokens):

    ```sh
    npm token create
    ```
    
    Copy the token value from the output to the Travis Environment Variable settings, and
    add it with the name `NPM_TOKEN`.
